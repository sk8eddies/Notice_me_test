1. I started with trying to make my project a git repository but it didn't work so i used dropbox temporarily.
2. I like mu UML- and er-diagrams since they're clear and easy to understand.
3. Nothing really went bad but for some reason GitHub wouldn't work as it usually does??
4. I got help with what er-diagrams are and Daniel helped me with creating a simple diagram of the Notice db.
