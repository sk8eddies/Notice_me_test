1. I started with trying to make my project a git repository but it didn't work so i used dropbox temporarily.
2. I like mu UML- and er-diagrams since they're clear and easy to understand.
3. Nothing really went bad but for some reason GitHub wouldn't work as it usually does??
4. I got help with what er-diagrams are and Daniel helped me with creating a simple diagram of the Notice db.

1. I've created all of the necessary html/css/js/flask-functions for a tag system. From my experience with
 working with Notice it is easier to create all of the functionality when the graphical parts are all
 in place. I needed to create a new html template and two flask-functions. I also needed to modify the home-template.
 Later on when I've finished the code and database mapping for the tags I need to upgrade some parts of the GIU
 so that the user can see the tags in the aside and on the notes and so that the user can filter Notes by tags.
2. This was easy stuff so everything went good I think. Nothing really challenging happened today. Got GitHub
 to work as I want it to. Works fine on my home computer for some reason?
3. I haven't had any problems so far.
4. I want to discuss with Daniel or David how I should implement the tag-system. What methods do I need?
